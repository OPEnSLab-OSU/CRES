Background:
  Currently the neutron probe used for detecting neutrons requires a radioactive source which provides fast neutrons.
  Since the neutron source provides a known flux of fast neutrons the neutron probe only detects thermal neutrons.
  It would be redunant for it to detect both.
  It would appear this device uses a fourior transform to tell detected gamma rays apart from neutrons.

Where we are: 
  Since we are currently building a thermal neutron detector first, we can ensure that our thermal neutron detector is on par with the 
  current standard for a neutron detector soil moisture probe. We hope that we do not need to use fourior transforms, 
  though arduino can do them. When we ensure that our thermal neutron detector is able to give us
  the same fast to thermal neutron ratio as the current standard we can look into creating a fast neutron detector.

  Background: 
    The scintilator in simple terms is a plastic or a crystal that emits light when a gamma ray or a particle event occurs.
    The SiPM(silicone photomultiplyer) is used to detect the light emitted from the scintilator.
    We are using the MIT Cosmic Watch V2 circuit board currently for the electronics read events.
    We want to use the data after collecting it for 8-10 hours when we have both detectors built so we do not need a radioactive source.
    
  Setup for thermal probe:
    We are using a 6x6mm SensL C-Series SiPM
    We are using two Ej-426 tiles and Ej-280 waveshifting bar configuration as a scinitilator 
    (info on the scinitlator setup on page 505 of Radiation Detection and Measurement in this github)
    The Ej-426 tiles detect the neutrons events and the waveshifting bar turns detected events into visable light for the SiPM.
    We are using the MIT Cosmic Watch V2 circuit board, it displays data on a LED screen or SD card via it's SD card slot.
    
  Potential Issues:
    Our configuration of two Ej-426 tiles and Ej-280 waveshifting bar configuration is not directly triggered by gamma ray events itself. 
    However, when the Ej-426 tiles detect a neutron, the breakdown of the lithium-6 will emit a 0.48 MeV gamma ray. 
    The SiPM by SensL documentation can be triggered by directly by gamma ray events.
   
   Suggested resolutions for potential issues:
    A fourior transform may be needed to differentate between gamma ray events and neutrons detected by the scinitlator configuration.
    Arduino has many libraries to perform a fast fourior transform(FFT), we just need to ensure that we can read the waveform of the SiPM
    to do the FFT. The current Mit Cosmic Watch V2 on the O-scope at the test point(TP3) going to the analog pin on the 
    nano showed the waveform. 
    
    Another possiblity is to have the arduino just collect the waveform data and then perform the FFT on a computer. Performing a FFT on
    the Arduino itself can be notoriously expensive for space. Using the SD card slot or transmitting the data to a computer are both
    options to save space on the arduino. The SD card may be the most practical solution since when the full system is built we will want
    to use the data after 8-10 hours.
