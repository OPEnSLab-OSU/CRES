# CRES(http://www.open-sensing.org/cosmic-ray-environmental-sensing) Gamma ray, thermal & fast neutron detection. Current focus is thermal & fast neutron detection. 


Currently has datasheets and files for thermal neutron detector being built. We recieved a contrabution from Eljen to detect thermal neutrons, which was two EJ-426 scinitilators, and one wavelengh shifting bar the EJ-280. We are currently trying to produce results with a 6mm SiPM, before switching to using three 1mm SiPM's.

We used MIT Cosmic Watch V2 (https://github.com/spenceraxani/CosmicWatch-Desktop-Muon-Detector-v2) as a starting point. For scinitilators the BC-408 was used.

The book 'Radiation Detection and Measurement, 3rd ed - Glenn F Knoll' is regarded by nuclear engineers as their go to for radiation detection. This book's pdf is included in the repository.
